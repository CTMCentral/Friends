     *     Optional. Data for populating the Message object.
     *
     *     @type Value    $value
     *           A concrete value.
     *     @type ErrorSet $error
     *           The set of errors in the critical path of evalution.
     *           Only errors in the critical path are included. For example,
     *           `(<error1> || true) && <error2>` will only result in `<error2>`,
     *           while `<error1> || <error2>` will result in both `<error1>` and
     *           `<error2>`.
     *           Errors cause by the presence of other errors are not included in the
     *           set. For example `<error1>.foo`, `foo(<error1>)`, and `<error1> + 1` will
     *           only result in `<error1>`.
     *           Multiple errors *might* be included when evaluation could result
     *           in different errors. For example `<error1> + <error2>` and
     *           `foo(<error1>, <error2>)` may result in `<error1>`, `<error2>` or both.
     *           The exact subset of errors included for this case is unspecified and
     *           depends on the implementation details of the evaluator.
     *     @type UnknownSet $unknown
     *           The set of unknowns in the critical path of evaluation.
     *           Unknown behaves identically to Error with regards to propagation.
     *           Specifically, only unknowns in the critical path are included, unknowns
     *           caused by the presence of other unknowns are not included, and multiple
     *           unknowns *might* be included included when evaluation could result in
     *           different unknowns. For example:
     *               (<unknown[1]> || true) && <unknown[2]> -> <unknown[2]>
     *               <unknown[1]> || <unknown[2]> -> <unknown[1,2]>
     *               <unknown[1]>.foo -> <unknown[1]>
     *               foo(<unknown[1]>) -> <unknown[1]>
     *               <unknown[1]> + <unknown[2]> -> <unknown[1]> or <unknown[2[>
     *           Unknown takes precidence over Error in cases where a `Value` can short
     *           circuit the result:
     *               <error> || <unknown> -> <unknown>
     *               <error> && <unknown> -> <unknown>
     *           Errors take precidence in all other cases:
     *               <unknown> + <error> -> <error>
     *               foo(<unknown>, <error>) -> <error>
