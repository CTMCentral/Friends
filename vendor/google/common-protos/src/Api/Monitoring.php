/**
 * Monitoring configuration of the service.
 * The example below shows how to configure monitored resources and metrics
 * for monitoring. In the example, a monitored resource and two metrics are
 * defined. The `library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count` metric is sent
 * to both producer and consumer projects, whereas the
 * `library.googleapis.com/book/overdue_count` metric is only sent to the
 * consumer project.
 *     monitored_resources:
 *     - type: library.googleapis.com/branch
 *       labels:
 *       - key: /city
 *         description: The city where the library branch is located in.
 *       - key: /name
 *         description: The name of the branch.
 *     metrics:
 *     - name: library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count
 *       metric_kind: DELTA
 *       value_type: INT64
 *       labels:
 *       - key: /customer_id
 *     - name: library.googleapis.com/book/overdue_count
 *       metric_kind: GAUGE
 *       value_type: INT64
 *       labels:
 *       - key: /customer_id
 *     monitoring:
 *       producer_destinations:
 *       - monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/branch
 *         metrics:
 *         - library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count
 *       consumer_destinations:
 *       - monitored_resource: library.googleapis.com/branch
 *         metrics:
 *         - library.googleapis.com/book/returned_count
 *         - library.googleapis.com/book/overdue_count
